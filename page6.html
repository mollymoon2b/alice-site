            <p>Creation of a type specimen for the typeface Kabel, designed by  Rudolf Koch and released by the Klingspor foundry in 1927. This publication aims to highlight the font, study the characteristics of
                the letters, the specificities of its drawing, its diverse uses and also its history through time.</p>

            <p> I chosed to work on the Kabel typography, and to pay tribute to the form of the font and the work of the typographer. I had to imagine a functional, aesthetic and educational presentation of typeface
                to target a new public who would not usualy be interested in Graphic design and typography.</p>

            <p>24x15, 40 pages.</p>
